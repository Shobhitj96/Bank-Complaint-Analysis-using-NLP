# **Bank Complaint Analysis Using NLP**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer complaints for a leading bank using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging text data, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models, the project aims to improve customer satisfaction and streamline complaint resolution.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Banks often receive numerous customer complaints daily, making it challenging to process and resolve them efficiently. The objective of this project is to:
1. Categorize complaints by product type.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
3. Provide actionable insights to enhance customer service and reduce resolution time.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: [Provide dataset link or mention it is synthetic].
- **Size**: [Number of rows and columns].
- **Key Features**:
  - `Complaint_Text`: The text of the customer complaint.
  - `Product_Type`: The category of the product/service related to the complaint.
  - `Sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).

## **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Dataset sourced from [mention source].
   - Loaded into Python for analysis.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Text Cleaning**: Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
   - **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words.
   - **Lemmatization**: Reduced words to their base forms.
   - **Vectorization**: Applied TF-IDF to convert text into numerical format.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed analysis to understand:
     - Distribution of sentiments.
     - Most frequent words in complaints.
     - Product categories with the highest number of complaints.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted text features using TF-IDF.
   - Engineered product-specific complaint categories for better insights.

### 5. **Model Development**
   - **Models Used**:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - **Evaluation Metrics**:
     - Accuracy: Achieved 82%.
     - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for imbalanced data.
   - Used SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

### 6. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Categorized complaints by product type for targeted solutions.
   - Identified most frequent complaint themes for proactive measures.
   - Recommended strategies to prioritize high-impact complaints for faster resolution.

### 7. **Results**
   - Achieved 82% accuracy in sentiment classification.
   - Provided actionable insights to improve customer service and satisfaction.
