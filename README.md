# Bank-Complaint-Analysis-using-NLP

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer complaints for a leading bank using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging text data, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models, the project aims to improve customer satisfaction and streamline complaint resolution.

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Banks often receive numerous customer complaints daily, making it challenging to process and resolve them efficiently. The objectives of this project are to:  
- Categorize complaints by product type.  
- Perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.  
- Provide actionable insights to enhance customer service and reduce resolution time.

---

## **Dataset**  
- **Source:** [Provide dataset link or mention if synthetic].  
- **Size:** [Number of rows and columns].  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `Complaint_Text`: Text of the customer complaint.  
  - `Product_Type`: Product/service category related to the complaint.  
  - `Sentiment`: Sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- Dataset sourced from [mention source].  
- Loaded into Python for analysis.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Text Cleaning:** Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.  
- **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words.  
- **Lemmatization:** Reduced words to their base forms.  
- **Vectorization:** Applied **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical format.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzed the distribution of sentiments.  
- Identified the most frequent words in complaints.  
- Determined product categories with the highest number of complaints.  

### **4. Feature Engineering**  
- Extracted text features using **TF-IDF**.  
- Engineered product-specific complaint categories for better insights.  

### **5. Model Development**  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Deep Learning Model:**  
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: 94%  
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for imbalanced data.  
- Used **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.  

### **6. Insights and Recommendations**  
- Categorized complaints by product type for targeted solutions.  
- Identified frequent complaint themes for proactive measures.  
- Recommended strategies to prioritize high-impact complaints for faster resolution.  

### **7. Results**  
- Achieved 94% accuracy in sentiment classification using the LSTM model.  
- Visualized sentiment trends and product-specific complaint distributions.  
- Provided actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction.
